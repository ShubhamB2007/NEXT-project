Reusable and modular React components.

🚫 Limitations
Not mobile responsive:
Due to time limitations, mobile responsiveness (for tablet and mobile devices) has not been implemented in this version.
This can be added with additional time for a fully responsive experience.
Also due to time limitations it was very difficult to add components for login and post form submission but it can be added.
